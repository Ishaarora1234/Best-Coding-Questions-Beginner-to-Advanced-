Input Format:
First line of input contians an integer T, representing the number of test cases.
Next T lines contains two space-separated integers: S,D
Constraints:
1 <= T <= 1000
1 <= D <= 1000
1 <= S <= 9*D
Time Limit: 1 second
Output Format
The output contains a single integer denoting the winning lottery number
Sample Input 1:
1
9 2
Sample Output 1:
18
